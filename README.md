## We are able to write Fortran inside HTML and see the results in the DOM

SETTING UP
==========

Upload the files index.html and ajax.js at you server. 

Also the files comis.cgi and main.cgi with permissions 755.

At the bottom of your page and after the DOM elements with id 'div-1', 'div-2', etc exist, the trigger() function sends the code for interpretation to the .cgi files.
